# OhMyKube Requirements FAQ

## Frequently Asked Questions About Requirements

### 1. **What Makes OhMyKube a "Real" Kubernetes Cluster?**

**Q**: How does OhMyKube differ from container-based solutions like kind or k3d?

**A**: OhMyKube creates "real" Kubernetes clusters by using actual virtual machines instead of containers to simulate nodes. This provides several key advantages:

- **True Resource Isolation**: Each node runs in its own VM with dedicated CPU, memory, and storage
- **Realistic Network Stack**: Full network stack including iptables, routing, and network interfaces
- **Production-Like Environment**: Same kernel, systemd, and system services as production
- **Storage Realism**: Real block devices and filesystem behavior
- **Security Boundaries**: VM-level isolation similar to production environments

**Current Implementation**: âœ… Fully implemented with Lima-based VMs

### 2. **MVP Scope and Harbor Registry**

**Q**: Is Harbor registry part of the core MVP or an optional feature?

**A**: Harbor registry is **not** part of the core MVP. The current scope is:

**Core MVP (âœ… Implemented)**:
- Basic cluster creation and management
- CNI plugins (Flannel, Cilium)
- CSI plugins (Local-Path-Provisioner, Rook-Ceph)
- MetalLB load balancer

**Optional Features (ðŸš§ Planned)**:
- Harbor registry (`ohmykube registry` command)
- Multi-cluster management
- Advanced monitoring and observability

Harbor will be implemented as a separate command that creates an additional VM with Harbor installed, not automatically included in `ohmykube up`.

### 3. **Configuration Options and Customization**

**Q**: What configuration options are available for cluster customization?

**A**: OhMyKube supports extensive configuration through command-line flags and custom configuration files:

**Resource Configuration** (âœ… Implemented):
```bash
ohmykube up --workers 3 --master-cpu 4 --master-memory 8 --master-disk 20 \
            --worker-cpu 2 --worker-memory 4 --worker-disk 10
```

**Component Selection** (âœ… Implemented):
```bash
ohmykube up --cni cilium --csi rook-ceph --k8s-version v1.33.0
```

**Custom kubeadm Configuration** (âœ… Implemented):
```bash
ohmykube up --kubeadm-config /path/to/custom-config.yaml
```

**Default Configuration**:
- 1 Master node (2 CPU, 4GB RAM, 20GB disk)
- 2 Worker nodes (1 CPU, 2GB RAM, 10GB disk each)
- Latest stable Kubernetes version
- Flannel CNI, Local-Path-Provisioner CSI, MetalLB LB

### 4. **Platform Compatibility and Support**

**Q**: Which operating systems and architectures are supported?

**A**: Current platform support status:

**Primary Support** (âœ… Production Ready):
- macOS arm64 (Apple Silicon)

**Secondary Support** (âœ… Functional):

**Error Handling**:
- Descriptive error messages with suggested solutions
- Automatic retry for transient failures
- Graceful degradation for partial failures
- Debug mode for troubleshooting

### 6. **Node Management and High Availability**

**Q**: What types of nodes can be added or removed?

**A**: Current node management capabilities:

**Worker Node Management** (âœ… Implemented):
- `ohmykube add`: Add worker nodes to existing cluster
- `ohmykube delete <node-name>`: Remove worker nodes
- Support for custom resource allocation per node
- Graceful pod eviction before node removal

**Control Plane Management** (ðŸš§ Planned):
- High Availability (HA) control plane support
- Multiple master node deployment
- Control plane node replacement
- Etcd backup and restore

**Current Limitations**:
- Only single master node supported
- Cannot add/remove control plane nodes
- HA features planned for Phase 2 development

### 7. **Version Dependencies and Compatibility**

**Q**: What are the version requirements for dependencies?

**A**: Specific version requirements and compatibility:

**Lima Requirements**:
- Minimum version: 1.0
- Recommended: Latest stable release
- Template support: Ubuntu 24.04 (default), custom templates supported

**Kubernetes Compatibility**:
- Supported versions: 1.24.x - 1.33.x

### 8. **Performance and Scalability**

**Q**: What are the performance characteristics and limits?

**A**: Performance specifications and limitations:

**Cluster Creation Performance**:
- Initial creation: 5-15 minutes (network dependent)
- Cached creation: 3-5 minutes
- Node addition: <1 minutes per node

**Scalability Limits**:
- Maximum worker nodes: 10 per cluster (hardware dependent)
- Maximum clusters: Limited by system resources
- Recommended: 1-5 worker nodes for development
