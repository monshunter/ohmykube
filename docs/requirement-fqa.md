1.  **Clarify the Key Features of a "Real Kubernetes Cluster"**:
    *   The document mentions building a "real" Kubernetes cluster to differentiate from Docker container simulation. It would be helpful to further clarify which "real" features must be included in the MVP version. For example:
        *   Multiple nodes (at least one control plane node, one worker node)?
        *   Does inter-node network communication require special configuration or simulation of specific scenarios?
        *   Will specific CNI (Container Network Interface) plugins be pre-installed?

2.  **Refine the Scope of the `MVP` (Minimum Viable Product)**:
    *   `ohmykube registry`: Create a local `Harbor` registry. This is a good feature, but is it part of the core MVP? Or is it an optional enhancement? Clarifying this helps prioritize development. If `Harbor` is part of the MVP, will `ohmykube up` automatically include Harbor deployment, or will users need to execute `ohmykube registry` separately?

3.  **Configuration Options**:
    *   Users may need to configure certain cluster parameters, such as:
        *   Virtual machine resource allocation (CPU, memory, disk).
        *   Kubernetes version.
        *   Number of nodes (how many nodes are created by default with `ohmykube up`?).
        *   Support for custom CNI plugins, etc.
    *   Is there consideration for supporting these configurations through configuration files or command-line parameters?

4.  **Operating System Compatibility**:
    *   Although Mac M chips are mentioned, `Lima` supports Windows and Linux. Are there plans to explicitly support these platforms? This may affect implementation details.

5.  **User Experience Details**:
    *   "Simple operation" is a good goal. Consider some specific scenarios to illustrate:
        *   Is the information output during command execution user-friendly?
        *   Are error handling and prompts clear?
        *   How do users obtain the kubeconfig file to access the cluster?

6.  **Definition of "Node"**:
    *   `ohmykube add`: Add a node. Does this refer to adding a worker node? Is there support for adding control plane nodes to achieve high availability (HA)? (HA may be beyond the MVP scope, but it's beneficial to clarify).
    *   `ohmykube delete`: Delete a node. Similarly, is this deleting a worker node or a control plane node?

7.  **Version Dependencies for `Lima` and `kubeadm`**:
    *   Are there specific version requirements or recommendations?

Overall, this requirements document provides a good starting point for the project. The above suggestions are primarily to help refine the requirements, make them more actionable, and reduce potential ambiguities in the subsequent development process. I hope these suggestions are helpful to you!
